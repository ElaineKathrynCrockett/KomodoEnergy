# Komodo Energy Coding Challenge

## Problem

## Setup
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.3
matplotlib==3.7.2
sklearn == 1.3.0

## Key assumptions
Tariff includes VAT. This is what the homeowner will pay.
Times are UTC
Usage pattern is on same day as tariff
Assume flexibility payment is in pounds
Heat pump usage is same as heat pump + battery
This is for a weekday
Ofgem elec tariff  (ignore standing charge) https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/energy-price-cap
No AI used
It's worth it if it's not too inconvenient and the cost is >10p


## Future work
Optimiser?
Fix 0.5 kWh
Different tariffs
Different power/duration
Additional devices to shift
Inconvenience during the day (not at home)
Also gain money from turn down
